            <div className="paragraph">In order to create the entrepreneurship culture among the students, 
                the Sree Buddha College of Engineering and Technopark – Technology Business Incubator (T–TBI) jointly 
                started the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Center with the full fledged support of the management.
                 This centre was inaugurated by the Secretary, Registrar and Managing Director of T-TBI and, the CFO, Technopark
                  Dr. K. C. Chandrasekharan Nair on 30 January 2014 <br /><br />
                  The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) is being promoted in educational institutions to 
                  develop institutional mechanism to create entrepreneurial culture in S&T academic institutions and to foster 
                  techno-entrepreneurship for generation of wealth and employment by S&T persons. <br /><br />
                  T-TBI provides incubatees with necessary infrastructure support, technology/ prototype development support, 
                  research assistance, help in getting funding, business consulting assistance and do whatever
                   is necessary to make the start-up a success. <br /> <br />
                   Dr. K. C. Chandrasekharan Nair said, in the current scenario the Multi-National companies cannot
                    provide proper placements due to global financial crises. Only 20 per cent of the students are 
                    passing out as Engineers among the large number of students who get admission in various Engineering 
                    Colleges every year. According to Dr. K. C. Chandrasekharan Nair, the bio-technology area is the most 
                    important area for creating the enterprises like the vertical farming system, i.e., cultivation without 
                    soil. The most highlighting session was the experiences shared by a young successful entrepreneur 
                    Mr. Libish Karat and other student entrepreneurs. The Secretary of Sree Buddha Educational Society, 
                    Prof. V. Prasad, delivered the presidential address. Treasurer Mr. K. K. Sivadasan, Principal Dr. Somi Sebastian and
                     Dean, Dr. E. K. Bhass were offer felicitation and ED Cell Co-ordinator, Assistant Professor. Meerabai proposed vote of thanks. <br /><br />
