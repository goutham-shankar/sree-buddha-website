        Intellectual property plays an important role in providing a competitive edge to any Institution.IPR Cell
        was constituted in  Sree Buddha College Of Engineering, Pattoor on <br /><br />

        May 15, 2018. The tangible assets like inventions, designs, software, brand name and other creative & 
        innovative ideas are more valuable than physical assets. <br /><br />

        Sree Buddha College of Engineering started an Intellectual property rights cell (SBCE IPR) under the leadership of
        Dr. K. KRISHNAKUMAR, Principal. SBCE IPR Cell is committed to encourage, protect, manage and commercialize Intellectual 
        Property such as Patent, Copyright, Trademark, etc. generated through the College. The cell creates a conducive environment
        in the academics for the development of Intellectual Property. Faculty and students of SBCE are actively participating 
        in the IPR filing process in different disciplines of Engineering, Science & Technology. <br /><br />

        <b>IMPORTANCE OF IPR</b><br /><br />

        It is necessary to protect the Intellectual property in order to enable organizations to earn recognition or financial benefits.
        Governments of various countries protect the innovative ideas of the inventors through Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Recently,
        IPR has become a central issue in the developed and developing countries. The rationale for this IPR lies in the need to create
        awareness about the importance of IPRs as a marketable financial asset and economic tool among the researchers, faculty and 
        students of the College. <br /><br />

        Intellectual property Rights: means the rights derived from the IP e.g. Patents, registered designs, copyright etc. <br /><br />

        Indian Government has revised the National IPR Policy in May 2016 and its vision, mission and objectives are given as follows. <br /><br />
