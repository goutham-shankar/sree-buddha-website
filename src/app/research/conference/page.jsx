             In his speech, he expressed the hope that the E2F2 conference will serve as an effective  platform for the faculty members, researchers 
             and students to discuss their innovative research ideas. <br /><br />

             The conferences under the E2F2 2018 series are inaugurated by the Chief Guest, Padmashree Dr.G. Shankar, Founder Chairman &Chief
              Architect, Habitat Technology Group.In the inaugural address, he advised the teachers of engineering colleges to impart basic 
              knowledge to the students in various subjects together with their practical applications, so that, the students get more 
              interested in those subjects. Shri.K.K. Sivadasan, Treasurer, Sree Buddha Educational society offered felicitations and 
              wished all the conferences to be successful. Dr. M. S. Senthil Saravanan delivered the vote of thanks. <br /><br />

              The focus of the keynote address by Padma Shree  Dr.G. Shankar was on all aspects of needs of the society – stressing on 
              sustainability – from drinking water to clothing to shelters, pavements, apartments and infrastructure development. The necessity 
              and importance of water conservation through recycling and water management through rain water harvesting and efficient 
              use of water was highlighted with ease with his wide and rich experience. He was also critical in the usage of materials of
               construction which are not sustainable, and logically explained the necessity of using locally available materials like
                mud, bamboo and the like.  He was eloquent about the rich engineering qualities of Bamboo as a building material and 
                stressed upon the need for further studies in bamboo structures. <br /><br />
