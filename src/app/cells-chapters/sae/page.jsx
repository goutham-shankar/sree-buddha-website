                    <h4>1. Bharath Stage VI Emission norms.</h4>
                    <p>Shri B Sreenivasan (General Manager, R&D, UCAL fuel systems) discussed about the pollutants in the exhaust gas of two wheelers that cause pollution and the emission norms. Among that one reflecting point come out is the induction of Bharat Stage VI engines in India in 2020. The most important problem we are facing nowadays is the pollution from vehicles due to emission of various gases such as CO, HC and NOx. So in order to reduce the emissions automotive sector must focus on making engines with less pollutant. For that research and experimentation are now going live to reach the task of making BS VI in 2020 as per the governments initiative. BS VI is a best solution to control emissions from vehicles because it produces only 1 kg/km of CO, 0.10 kg/km of Hydrocarbons, 0.06 NOx and .068 of NMHC rather than 1.403 kg/km of CO, 0.79 Hydrocarbon, and 0.39 NOx in BS IV.</p>
                    <h4>2. Green fuels</h4>
                    <p>Dr.E.Rajasekar, Secretary, SAEINDIA discussed about the importance of Green fuels such as electricity, ethanol, methanol, natural gas and hydrogen. Comparing each fuel and its efficiency only hydrogen (67.7% efficient) can give a best solution to replace petroleum fuels (83.3%). Hydrogen gas is non polluting, renewable and cheaper in near future but its storage and low power production is a big challenge to achieve. Electric vehicle is a good option but replacement of battery is a big trouble due to high cost. Finally Dr Rajasekar implied that complete replacement of IC engine is not possible, only we can do is apply replacement in possible sector.</p>
