        In pursuance of action plan for performance evaluation, assessment,
        accreditation, and quality up-gradation of institutions of higher
        education, NAAC proposes that every accredited institution should
        establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a
        post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality
        enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of the
        institutionâ€™s system & work towards realization of the goals of quality
        enhancement & sustenance. The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a
        system for conscious, consistent & catalytic improvement in the overall
        performance of institutions. For this, during the post-accreditation
        period, it will channelize all efforts & measures of the institution
        towards promoting its holistic academic excellence.
