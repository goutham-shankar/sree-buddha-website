          “The National Board of Accreditation (NBA), India was initially
          established by AICTE (All India Council of Technical Education) under
          section 10(u) of AICTE act, in the year 1994, for periodic evaluations
          of technical institutions & programs basis according to specified
          norms and standards as recommended by AICTE council. NBA in its
          present form came into existence as an autonomous body with effect
          from 7th January 2010, with the objective of Assurance of Quality and
          Relevance of Education, especially of the programs in professional
          disciplines”.The purpose of the accreditation by NBA is to promote and
          recognize excellence in technical education in colleges and
          universities—at both the undergraduate and post graduate levels.
          Institutions, students, employers, and the public at large all benefit
          from the external verification of quality provided through the NBA
          accreditation process. They also benefit from the process of
          continuous quality improvement that is encouraged by the NBA’s
          developmental approach to promote excellence in technical education.
