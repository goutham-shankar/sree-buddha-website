            <p>The Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering was established in 2004, as the sixth department of this college, with an annual intake of 60 students for the B Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering program. An M Tech programme in Electrical Machines was started in 2014 with an annual intake of 24 students. The department is dedicated to the promotion of excellence in Engineering education, imparting knowledge to students in the field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering so that they can successfully complete their graduation and secure proper placement. Many of our students stand in a better position in Kerala Technological University, and a good number of them occupy prestigious positions both within the country and abroad.</p>

            <p>The department&apos;s laboratories are well-equipped for the conduct of the existing courses. The facilities available in the department are sufficient to meet the requirements of B Tech and M Tech project works. The department has a well-equipped computer center with internet access. In addition to the central library, there is a departmental library where most of the books prescribed in the syllabus are available. The existing faculty and supporting staff are highly qualified, experienced, and dedicated. All teachers hold M Tech/M.E. degrees, and some are pursuing their PhDs. The advisory system is very effective in regular evaluation of students and in informing progress to students&apos; parents. Almost all students who have passed out from the department are well placed, and many have obtained GATE scores. The department has excellent contacts with neighboring industries like KSEB and NTPC. It also publishes a monthly newsletter called &quot;Impulse.&quot;</p>
