            <p>
                In order to fit into the modern era of technology advancement, the Dept. of EEE lays considerable importance to in-house research. Due to the presence of a PG programme in the dept. in the area of Electrical Machines, much of the researches take place in this domain. These researches are carried out by the PG students, under the guidance of various faculties of the department. Some of the research topics in this domain are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design of new kinds of electrical machines, e.g. design of rotary linear switched reluctance motor for applications involving hybrid motion.</li>
                <li>Position, speed & torque control of various electrical machines through different methods, e.g. Sensor-less control of BLDC motors.</li>
                <li>Development of environment-friendly electric drives, e.g. Implementation of low-cost converter for an autonomous photovoltaic water pumping system.</li>
                <li>Development of energy-saving schemes, e.g. Energy regeneration during the braking of electric vehicles.</li>
                <li>Fault detection in various machines, e.g. Novel bearing fault detection and analysis of induction machines.</li>
                <li>Development of sensors for condition monitoring of electrical machines, e.g. Development of cost-effective sensor for estimation of dissolved moisture in transformer oil.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To support these researches, in addition to the regular electrical machines lab, there is a full-fledged research lab in the department with custom-designed Induction Motor, BLDC motor and SRM motor drives and their controllers for analysis and advanced machine design & control software such as Maxwell, Simplorer, and MATLAB. Apart from the research carried out in the PG stream, many developments are also done by the UG students under the guidance of various faculties in the department.
