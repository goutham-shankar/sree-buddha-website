            <h3 className='heading1' >About</h3>
            <p>The Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning was founded in 2020 and offers an undergraduate program, B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), through APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University in Kerala.</p>

            <p>SBCE strives to impart effective technical education through experiential learning and develop concrete infrastructure with efficient faculty and a dynamic student community to achieve higher targets in higher education in India. It insists on implementing Outcome-Based Education (OBE) throughout the undergraduate tenure by attaining university ranks, achieving higher placement records, and fostering improved higher-order thinking.</p>

            <p>We are dedicated to constructing top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top models of human-level intelligence. Our focus is on building systems that provide intelligent tutoring, create adaptive and intelligent entertainment systems, make systems that understand their own behavior, and grow our understanding of autonomous agents that adapt in dynamic environments. We work on predicting human behavior, automating creativity, and addressing various other challenges.</p>

            <p>To emphasize lifelong learning and applying knowledge to solve real-world problems, we conduct various technical events such as hackathons, coding competitions, training programs, workshops, and seminars. We aim to provide the best learning experience to our students, enriching their skills and knowledge.</p>

            <p>Our initiatives will undoubtedly shape students to face the outside world with technical, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills. We collaborate with various firms and regularly organize industry visits, technical talks, and real-time projects to hone students technical and soft skills, preparing them to be industry-ready with holistic personalities.</p>
