            <p>
            Welcome to the Department of Food Technology at Sree Buddha College of Engineering, which was started in the year 2020 to commemorate the VISION 2020 of late Bharat Ratna Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (Former Honâ€™ble President of India, Scientist and Academician), committing to advancements in research and education in the field of Food Technology.  Food Technology is not confined to science, technology, engineering, or management since it has a wide range of scope and multidimensional in various applications. Our SBCE management run by academicians envisioned the department of Food Technology because of the present and future demands in various sectors of food and allied processing arena.
            </p>

            <p>Globally, Food science and technology research has been making substantial development to ensure quality, hygiene and safety in production, packing, handling and storage divisions. It is ultimate to develop state-of-art infrastructure in relation to various food sectors and equip students with specially designed curriculum of Food Technology programme and mould them into technocrats of the field. The most-suited branch to serve the human society is this particular branch of study which takes all major commodities into account from all basic needs to higher-end space foods. Global problems like malnutrition, starvation, famine and other calamities interconnected with food crisis could be completely eradicated with advancements and research in Food Technology. Also, socio-economic and regional landscapes of different parts of our country especially Kerala has been actively involving in importing and exporting of various food products due to insufficiency of processing technology and experience.  To fulfill the requirements, nation building with food technology is the need of hour to address these emerging needs. Moreover, technological advancements and increased awareness about food quality, hygiene, and safety have created numerous job opportunities in food production and handling sectors. Recognizing the vital importance of Food Processing and Technology, the Government of India and Kerala have implemented revolutionary measures to empower the field and developed various career opportunities like FSSAI officer, Food safety officer, Food Microbiologist etc.</p>

            <p>Our Food Technology curriculum is meticulously crafted, encompassing diverse courses and laboratory sessions and also with industrial involvement as Implant training, Visits and Expert talk. Our department is equipped with advanced facilities and modern equipment, overseen by experts from various disciplines within Food Technology. Moreover, our research endeavours are robust, supported by grants and strategic partnerships with leading industrial sectors and universities.</p>

            <p>Once again, I welcome you to the Sree Buddha Family especially to the quality time in the Department of Food Technology, in which students will relish and have productive experience to meet out variety of scope of opportunities in the field during their time of study.</p>
