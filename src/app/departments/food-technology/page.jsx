        <p class="has-normal-font-size">
            Food processing has been identified as the sunrise industry due to its enormous impact and significance in the Indian development sector. The importance of food &amp; process engineering lies in the fact that it has the capability to provide food to our population through scientific conservations, eliminating available losses and making available more balanced and nutritious food. To work in a food processing industry, one has to learn and acquire detailed knowledge of the subject and earn a degree in the field. Recognizing the potential in this sector, the department was started in 2020. Our courses are designed to expand understanding of the biological, microbiological, chemical, physical, sensory, nutritional, and engineering properties of foods and beverages.
